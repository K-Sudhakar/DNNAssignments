# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Place the dataset CSV at:

```
data/breast_cancer_wisconsin_diagnostic.csv
```

**Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)

The CSV should include the UCI WDBC columns (`id`, `diagnosis`, 30 numeric feature columns) and a
`target` column where `1` = malignant and `0` = benign. If the `target` column is missing, the
notebook will derive it from `diagnosis`.
